	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2404.06370},
	abstract = {Purpose: Multicriteria decision analysis ({MCDA}) has become increasingly essential for decision-making in complex environments. In response to this need, the {pyDecision} library, implemented in Python and available at https://bit.ly/3tLFGtH, has been developed to provide a comprehensive and accessible collection of {MCDA} methods. Methods: The {pyDecision} offers 70 {MCDA} methods, including {AHP}, {TOPSIS}, and the {PROMETHEE} and {ELECTRE} families. Beyond offering a vast range of techniques, the library provides visualization tools for more intuitive results interpretation. In addition to these features, {pyDecision} has integrated {ChatGPT}, an advanced Large Language Model, where decision-makers can use {ChatGPT} to discuss and compare the outcomes of different methods, providing a more interactive and intuitive understanding of the solutions. Findings: Large Language Models are undeniably potent but can sometimes be a double-edged sword. Its answers may be misleading without rigorous verification of its outputs, especially for researchers lacking deep domain expertise. It's imperative to approach its insights with a discerning eye and a solid foundation in the relevant field. Originality: With the integration of {MCDA} methods and {ChatGPT}, {pyDecision} is a significant contribution to the scientific community, as it is an invaluable resource for researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers navigating complex decisionmaking problems and seeking the most appropriate solutions based on {MCDA} methods.},

The method produces for each alternative an acceptability index measuring the variety of different valuations that support that alternative, a central weight vector representing the typical valuations resulting in that decision, and a confidence factor measuring whether the input data is accurate enough for making an informed decision. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, the strategies to perform energy systems analysis have evolved into multiple criteriabased frameworks. However, there still remains a lack of guidance on how to select the most suitable Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. These methods provide different decision recommendations for the Decision Makers, including ranking, sorting, choice, and clustering of the alternatives (e.g., technologies or scenarios) under evaluation. They deal with a variety of data typologies and preferences, and lead Decision Makers in shaping the energy systems of the future. Here, we evaluate the MCDA methods used in 56 case studies performing energy systems analysis at different scales. We find that close to 60\% of these studies chose an MCDA method that was not the most adequate for the respective decision problem. In particular, this concerned the use of weighting methods (e.g., Analytical Hierarchy Process) in MCDA approaches not suited for this type of weights, sub-optimal selection of MCDA techniques for specific types of problem statements, and lack of handling rather evident interactions in preference models. Our analysis demonstrates that these deficiencies can be overcome by using a recently developed methodology and software that support Decision Makers and analysts in selecting the most suitable MCDA method for a given type of decision-making problem.},

	abstract = {Environmental decisions are complex as they are multi-dimensional, highly interdisciplinary and not only involve multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives, but also many possible alternatives with uncertain consequences. The difficulty lies in making trade-offs between tough value trade-offs on the one hand while appreciating uncertain impacts of alternatives on the other. To support decisions tackling such problems, a combination of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and environmental models is promising yet limited by the available MCDA software. Here, we present Decisi-o-rama, an open-source Python MCDA library for single and sets (portfolios) of alternatives in the context of multi-attribute value/utility theory (MAUT/MAVT). Its development was driven by four aspirations that are crucial for usability in the context of environmental decision-making: (1) interoperability, (2) uncertainty-awareness, (3) computational efficiency, and (4) integra­ tion with portfolio decisions. The results indicate that these aspirations are met, thus facilitating the adoption of MCDA methods by environmental researchers and practitioners.},

Their adoption by global institutions has further captured the attention of the media and policymakers around the globe, and their number of applications has surged ever since. This increase in their popularity has solicited a plethora of methodological contributions in response to the substantial criticism surrounding their underlying framework. In this paper, we put composite indicators under the spotlight, examining the wide variety of methodological approaches in existence. In this way, we offer a more recent outlook on the advances made in this field over the past years. Despite the large sequence of steps required in the construction of composite indicators, we focus particularly on two of them, namely weighting and aggregation. We find that these are where the paramount criticism appears and where a promising future lies. Finally, we review the last step of the robustness analysis that follows their construction, to which less attention has been paid despite its importance. Overall, this study aims to provide both academics and practitioners in the field of composite indices with a synopsis of the choices available alongside their recent advances.},

	abstract = {While environmental composite indexes are useful tools in ranking the relative performance of countries on characteristics of interest, critiques are being made about their lack of relevance and responsiveness pertaining to changes in the environment; this negatively aﬀects their usefulness and relevance. In this paper, an alternative to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is proposed by constructing a proof-of-concept index based on component variables whose changes reﬂect the actual state of the environment and the environmental sustainability on the particular dimensions measured. The proposed Environmental State and Sustainability Index (ESSI) also takes into account the relationships between variables in constructing the composite index by checking the relevance of the theoretical environmental dimensions against factor components, which explains the complex relationships between environmental variables and aims at achieving a relevant weighting of the component variables. Results indicate that ESSI scores are comparable with EPI and reﬂect better the actual situation of some countries with high-rank diﬀerences. Thus, ESSI can be used as a basis for constructing or revising environmental indicators that are closer to the objective of achieving a truly overarching measure of the state of the environment that is relevant in informing policy and reﬂect actual changes in the component dimensions as relevant data becomes available.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents various approaches to incorporating formal modelling of risks and uncertainties into multi-criteria decision analysis, in a theoretically valid but also operationally meaningful manner. We consider both internal uncertainties (in the formulation and modelling of the decision problem), and external uncertainties arising from exogenous factors, but with greater attention paid to the latter. After a broad discussion on the meaning of uncertainty, we first review approaches to sensitivity analysis, which is particularly, although not exclusively, relevant to internal uncertainties. We discuss the role, but also some limitations, of representing uncertainties in formal probabilistic structures, linked also to concepts of expected (multi-attribute) utility theory. Such probability/utility approaches may be used in explicitly identifying a most preferred solution, or simply to eliminate certain courses of action when stochastically dominated (in various senses) by others. In some contexts it may be useful to view minimization of various risk measures as additional criteria in more standard MCDA models, and we comment on advantages and disadvantages of such approaches. Finally we discuss the integration of MCDA with scenario planning, in order to deal with deeper uncertainties (not easily if at all representable by probability models), particularly in a strategic planning context. The emphasis throughout is on the practice of MCDA rather than on esoteric theoretical results.},
